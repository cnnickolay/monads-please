# Monads, please
What do you know about monads? Right, nothing. Free monads does ring a bell? Okay, I got it. Same here.

In this project I'm trying to dive into the core of monadic design using Scalaz library, with a specific target for free monads. 
There are lot of challenges along the way, just imagine a Free Monad wrapped into a Free Monad... yeah, that kind of stuff.

So buckle up, it's gonna be fun.
