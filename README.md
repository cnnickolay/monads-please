# Monads, please
What do you know about monads? Right, nothing. Free monads does ring a bell? Okay, I got it. Same here.

In this project I'm trying to dive into the core of monadic design using Scalaz library, with a specific target for free monads. 
There are lot of challenges along the way, just imagine a Free Monad wrapped into a Free Monad... yeah, that kind of stuff.

Another big thing which bothers me is enabling parallel execution of Free Monads, things like Applicatives and sequenceU MUST be able to run in parallel. There IS a way :P

So buckle up, it's gonna be fun.
